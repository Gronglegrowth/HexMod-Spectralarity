# Hex Casting (Spectralarity)

This is a custom fork of Hex Casting specifically for [Spectralarity](https://modrinth.com/modpack/spectralarity). Differences from the original shall be noted in this file as they are made. The original mod's [readme can be viewed here](https://github.com/FallingColors/HexMod).

## Planned changes
1. The mod will become dependent on Spectrum.
2. Spectrum's gemstone shards and powders will contain media; and Spectrum's amethyst powder will replace Hex's amethyst powder.
3. The Patchouli guidebook will be adjusted to account for the modpack's changes to its recipes.
