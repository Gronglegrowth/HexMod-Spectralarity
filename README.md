# Hex Casting (Spectralarity)

This is a custom fork of Hex Casting specifically for [Spectralarity](https://modrinth.com/modpack/spectralarity). The original mod's [readme can be viewed here](https://github.com/FallingColors/HexMod). This fork, being designed for a specific pack, is not recommended for use outside of it, and no support will be given in this case.

## Changes
- Updated the minimum version of Fabric API from 0.64 to 0.76.
- Mod is dependent on Spectrum 1.7.6.

## Planned changes
1. Spectrum's gemstone shards and powders will contain media; and Spectrum's amethyst powder will replace Hex's amethyst powder.
2. The Patchouli guidebook will be adjusted to account for the modpack's changes to its recipes.
